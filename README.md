# Vice City Emergency Responders
## A SAMP Copchase Gamemode.
(Licensed under GNU GPLv3)


I meant to release this gamemode a while ago but I never got around to it. I discussed open sourcing the project with another one of the devs of this project (who I still have contact with) and he agreed and thought it would be best to do that. I got in contact with another project dev and he agreed to me open sourcing the project.

I'm no longer really interested in programming for SAMP as a whole. The language isn't very good and it's not even OOP hence why I'm sticking with Python and C#. This project will be provided as-is and support for it will be limited.

## Developers:
- Bork (me)
- Gravityfalls
- Duco

## Required Dependencies:
- MySQL r41-4
- crashdetect
- streamer
- sscanf
- Pawn.CMD
- nativechecker
- Redis? (If you wanna use SAMP rediscord. It's all commented anyway and isn't required)
- You should use the latest version of all of these deps.

## Known issues and bugs:
- Map creation and adding in spawns doesn't occur correctly.
- As a result, spawning into a game doesn't work either.
- DM mode is incomplete (not a issue).

## Extra Credits:
- rogercosta93 for his Vice City for SAMP map (https://github.com/rogercosta93/Vice-City-for-SA-MP).
- Sprenner and myself for spending a couple hours fixing some of the mapping bugs.
- Emmet_ for some of the custom functions that he made in his South Central RP script.
- And any other people who contributed to this project (if you would like your credits please create a issue and I'll add them in).
